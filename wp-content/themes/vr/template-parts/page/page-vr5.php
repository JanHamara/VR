                <p>
                    Many of us cannot imagine what life with a disability feels like, whether we talk about a movement impairment, learning disability, autism, dyslexia or any other, a disability always changes the life of the individual to a nightmare, compared to living a normal life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some individuals cope with their disability amazingly well and are an inspiration to all of us, some of them are not so fortunate. Despite that, each and every one of these individuals deserve a chance for better life and if we can do anything to help them in this quest, we definitely should do so.

                <p>
                    As a very keen traveler myself and a student of Digital Media, I have created this website to be in accordance with the criteria of Web Accessibility, as defined by <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/" target="_blank">W3C Consortium</a>. It is meant to be usable by all people with various disabilities and it's purpose is to explain to them what Virtual Reality technology is, how they can use it, how they can buy equipment for it, what applications there are available, and so on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, even if I manage to reach a wider audience of disabled people with this website, VR equipment is currently still extremely expensive and thus I have decided to add a donation option to the website, <strong>where people who want to help the cause, could donate a voluntary amount of money towards VR equipment for disabled people</strong>.
